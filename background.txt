Hello COM530! My name is Josh, and I am a student of Technical Communication at IIT. Additionally, I am a full time staff member for the university. This fall, I expanded my presence in the IIT community by joining the TechCom certificate program to augment my technical communication skills. Ultimately, my goal is to apply my technical skills to further my career in law. Outside of the IIT campus, I enjoy traveling, exploring new neighborhoods in this great city, and entertaining friends over dinner and wine, of course!

I graduated from Purdue University in 2010, and began working at IIT shortly thereafter. Upon entering the workforce, I realized early on that in order to grasp the demands of a modern workplace, mastery of technical skills is of key importance.

Over the course of the semester, I hope my time in COM530 is well spent learning the basics of designing websites and digging a little deeper into some of the technologies I rely on daily to complete my work.
